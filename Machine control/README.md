# PCB for machine control using eringerli code
In this repository are the PCB design files for machine control used in AgOpenGPS systems. These PCBs integrate 1 ESP32, an ADS1115 A/D converter for WAS, and a CanBus transceiver (untested). The machine control uses the code originally made by `eringerli`. Updated code is in process to use all features of this module (not on Github yet).

This PCB is designed to use the plug (DTM13-12PA-12PB-R008) and enclosure (EEC-325X4B) made by TE Connectivity.
