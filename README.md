# PCB modules for AOG 
In this repository are the PCB design files to use with AOG. In each folder is a project complete with files needed to edit the Fritzing PCB design files. For further information, see the README within each folder.

Since Fritzing files cannot be diffed with Git history, as Git sees them as a binary blob, please do not commit changes and ask for a pull request without contacting me first. It is much preferred to discuss the PCB changes before editing the PCB design files.
